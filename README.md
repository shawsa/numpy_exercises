# numpy_exercises
Some exercises to test/improve your usage of numpy.


All problems are in python files prefixed with `exercise` and the corresponding solutions are in files prefixed with `solution`. To test your solutions, add a function with the same function signature as the `sol_check` function in that exercise, and be sure to append it to the solutions list. Then run the exercise file. The exercise file will import code from the solutions file, so there is no need to run the solutions file. 

When the exercise file runs, it will check the correctness of all of the solutions (it does not catch exceptions and exit gracefully) then it times all of the solutions and compares them to the `sol_check` version.
